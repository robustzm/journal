Programmers are notoriously bad at estimating. There's a lot of reasons for this, but I want to talk about one in particular that I don't think has gotten a lot of attention. (Or, if it has, I missed out.) It relies on what I think is an outright cognitive bias. Since I've never seen it named before, I'll Christen it:

The invent-implement fallacy occurs when we believe the the effort required to implement something is close to the effort required to *invent* it.

Here's a concrete example. For most competent programmers, implementing Tetris is a weekend endeavor. Therefore, we look at what Alexey Pajitnov did and say, "Oh, creating puzzle games is easy. He could have come up with Tetris in a couple of days."

That's the fallacy right there. Did you catch it? We wrongly equated two *fundamentally different* activities:

1. Implementing Tetris *when you already know all of the game mechanics.*
2. Implementing Tetris *when you don't have any idea which game mechanics will work and which won't.*

The difference in difficulty of these two tasks can completely overwhelm the part they have in common: implementing it.

...

I think part of the problem here is that we aren't very good at imagining what it's like to *not* know something.
