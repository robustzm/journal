**TODO: Describe her being dumb.**

It's my 30th birthday, and Megan and I are walking down Duval Street in Key West. There is a pet store here, which must be the most unlikely place for a pet store in all the world. Everyone here is a tourist. What kind of idiot buys a dog while on vacation?

You are in the window surrounded by other puppies. A tottering orange ball of fuzz with little triangular ears, like a fox who lost its tail. Ink-black eyes and round button nose. My wife, pregnant and hormonal, is instantly in love with you. We go inside to play with the puppies, because why would you not want to play with cute puppies while on vacation? You are calm and sleepy in my arms. I can almost fit your entire body in my cupped hands.

Megan gives me an unending series of Significant Looks, which I do my best to ignore. I try to avoid making dumb decisions, and impulsively buying a puppy while on vacation eight hours from home is clearly in the category of dumb decisions.

I make a silent vow to never let Megan know that I also fell in love with you the moment I saw you.

---

It's the next day and Megan and I are sitting at a Burger King also on Duval. She is presenting her case for why we should buy this very cute half-Pomeranian half-Yorkie puppy even though:

1. We are on vacation.
2. We are expecting our first child in a couple of months and already have more than enough to keep us busy.
3. We have absolutely no plans or intentions on getting a pet. Our house is *tiny* and barely fits the two of us and two cats, much less a baby and a dog.
4. We are an eight-hour drive from home.
5. You are, in fact, quite expensive.

Do I even need to write the numbered list here? It's obviously a terrible idea. My family that we're on vacation with looked at us like we were idiots when we said we were considering it.

I think very very hard about my first dog, a Sheltie named Snickers. When I was seven I was playing in a neighbor's yard while she was out with me. I wasn't paying attention and she was hit by a car. I had to carry her limp body all the way home, tears streaming down my face. The shocked look on my mother's face when she saw my arrive at home is my most vivid childhood memory.

I am the kind of person who always analyzes way too many steps ahead. Getting a dog means signing up for the whole ride, including the end of it. I am choosing to break my own heart. What if it's not worth the pain?

Megan is driving us north from Miami. You are sleeping in my lap, impossibly warm, cold wet nose pressed against my arm. We talk about names. You almost end up "Dorito" because of your triangular orange ears, but it doesn't stick. Instead, you become "Ginny". Not for Ginny Weasely like everyone assumes but short for the liquor genever.

---

When we buy you, I also buy some books on dog training because I am the kind of person who wants to be a very good dog owner that follows all the dog owning rules. Rule #1 is crate training starts immediately. A dog won't respect you as the pack leader if they are free to sleep where you do. They'll think they run the pack.

We get home at night after all the pet stores have closed. Next to the bed, I try to improvise some crate-like thing for you to spend your first night involving cardboard boxes, a cooler, and anything else I can find around the house. You yowl in terror, or perhaps just anger at the poor accommodations.

Eventually, I give up. I pick you up and lay you on my chest. You are asleep instantly, tiny heart fluttering against mine.

You are taking your sweet time exploring every single corner of the jungle that is our backyard, looking for lizards. It is three o'clock in the morning. The anoles are sleeping under leaves where you never find them. I am shambling after you in pajama pants and old boots willing you to pee with every ounce of willpower I have.

I am keenly aware of my dwindling opportunities to get a good night's sleep before the baby arrives. Yet here we are. Over the past few weeks Megan and I have mostly learned to tell the difference between your yowl that means "I am a puppy and don't like being alone in this crate" and the yowl that means "My bladder is too small to last the night and I need to pee right now." Sorry about the mistakes we made while figuring this one out.

I pee in the yard too, hoping you'll get the hint. I deeply regret ever seeing you in that pet store window. Half-awake, I have vivid fantasies of building a time machine, traveling back in time, and slapping myself in the middle of that Key West Burger King.

After patrolling the perimeter of the yard in tiny puppy steps, twice, you finally pee. I tell you what a good girl you are and give you a treat.

---

As you grow, your puppy fuzz is replaced by silk, still orange on top and white on the bottom like a fox. The whorls of fur behind your ears are the softest thing I have ever felt in my life. I run my fingers through them constantly, to your delight.

---

Five weeks earlier than expected, Megan and I become parents. We didn't finish turning the other bedroom into a nursery so we hastily get a bassinet. The first night, we realize there isn't enough room at the foot of the bed for both the bassinet and the crate.

We let you sleep on the bed. You are clearly proud of yourself for having earned pride of place on the bed while the new pink hairless dog is relegated to the funny crate.

---

You are listless and frothing at the mouth. Megan and I are terrified. You had been in the yard stalking all of the various animals that live in the barely-tamed-jungle that is Orlando. This time, you found a toad and you'd managed to get your mouth on it before I could get to you. Did it poison you? Are you going to die?

We rush you to the emergency vet. She takes your vitals while you sit there limp. Your blood sugar is dangerously low. She gives you a treat. Then another. You immediately perk up. You're fine, totally fine.

I remember that a couple of days prior I put my foot down and decided you were ready to graduate from soft puppy food to kibble which is better for your teeth. You were uninterested in the new food. I confidently told Megan, "Once she gets hungry enough, she'll eat it." Apparently not. I guess somehow during the thousands of years humans spent turning a wolf into the strange-colored, tiny, eternally cub-like thing that you are, we accidentally broke your survival instinct. Sorry about that. We learn to mix some wet food into your kibble.

It is something like four in the morning and Megan and I are pushing a baby stroller and a luggage cart across the airport with you and the cats crammed in pet carriers perched on top of our suitcases. We've just flown 3,000 miles to our new home in Seattle. Our brilliant idea to take a red-eye flight so the baby would sleep through it had failed disastrously. Megan and I have been up all night taking turns trying to get the baby to sleep on our laps. You seem to have mostly survived the flight intact. The cats were less thrilled by the experience.

We get to the hotel, and I take you out just as the sun starts to come up. The parking lot of an Extended Stay in Redmond is my first view of our new home in the Pacific Northwest. It's fifty degrees and rainy. I'm dead tired. Of course, you take your sweet time before finding the right spot to pee.

We are on PetFinder looking for a second dog. You are just, so... weird. Not food motivated. Impossible to train. High strung. Frankly, not very smart. You bark all the time, at everything. We tell ourselves that a second dog will give you company when we're out. They will teach you how to dog like a normal dog.

We find a part-Chihuahua part rat terrier that is, in defiance of everything I understand about genetics, practically your twin. We bring you to meet him at a dog park to see if you get along. You bark a lot. He tolerates you admirably well. For the rest of your lives, you will be his asshole boss. You'll eat the best parts out of his food bowl and steal his treats. When he tries to sit next to us on the couch, you will wedge yourself in the middle and glare at us both.

Maybe they were right about the crate training.

---

We rent a house out in the sticks. There is a green belt behind the yard and we get deer sometimes. Occasionally, we hear an owl hoot. Inexplicably, you are absolutely terrified of the sound. Megan and I hoot at you to tease you and you bark back at us.

Later, we buy a house with a fenced in back yard. You stand in the grass staring at us until we make eye contact with us. The second we do, you throw your head back and run full tilt to us. Over and over again from Megan to me and back. You wear yourself out and lay in the sun panting "keh keh keh". When you jump in bed that night, you still smell like dirt and grass.

---

I lay in bed staring at the dark ceiling, doing math in my head. Tonight, you are the same age in dog years that I am in real years. From this moment on, you'll be older than me. I picture you racing ahead of my into the future. I try not to think of where that path leads or when you'll get there.

You are sleeping stretched out, pressed against my thigh, trying to get every square millimeter of contact that you can. I run my fingers through the fur on your back.

---

The vet is explaining to us that you have hyperthyroidism and congestive heart disease. That's why you're peeing all the time (inside and outside), and why you seem so tense and wound up all the time. Well, that and because you're half Pomeranian.

You get put on expensive pill regiment which you will take for the rest of your life. Since you aren't very interested in food even on a good day, getting you to take these will be a constant battle. At least the peeing inside gets marginally better. The barking does not.

---

We rent a cabin on the Pacific coast. You spend the first half of the drive shaking in excitement and anxiety, paws on the door looking out the window. The whole car smells like your horrid breath and Megan is absolutely covered in orange fur. Eventually you wear yourself out and pass out in her lap, head draped over her arm towards me. I idly rub the fur between your ears while I drive.

After settling in, we go explore tide pools. You sniff everything. Every rock, bit of kelp, rotting fish, even the wind. It's cold and wet, but you don't seem to mind. When we get back to the cabin, I wipe the sand and seaweed from your paws. You fall asleep in front of the fireplace.

---

I start writing a second book. I work on my laptop on the couch and you sleep pressed against one leg the entire time. When he can get away with it, Benny claims the other side.

---

It's six o'clock in the morning. I am barely awake making coffee while you are outside for your morning consitutional. You make a funny sound at the back door. I open it just in time to see you collapse. I scoop you up and run into the dining room yelling out for Megan. I sit on the floor and cradle you, rocking back and forth. I think to myself that if these are your last moments, I want them to be peaceful and in my arms.

You are limp. Your tongue hangs out, lifeless and blue. I am seven years old again.

Then you slowly come back to us. Your back stiffens. Your legs poke out like a fainting goat and then relax. Your eyes start darting around and eventually you are able to pick your head up. Ten minutes later and you are back to normal, or at least as normal as you ever are.

The vet starts using the phrase "congestive heart *failure*" now. The pill regimen gets more complex. We throw out yet another irreparable rug and this time decide to just not put another one down for now.

---

**TODO: Move up. Wasn't much time between fainting and the end.**

We take another trip out to the Olympic Peninsula with friends. You spend much of it sleeping on the couch in front of the fire, like a little self-warming throw pillow. You get lots of affection from everyone, which you regard as your proper due.
