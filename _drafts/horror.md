> The dish was delicious in part because it was so unsettling. I had to think very hard about what I was tasting and why I was having this intense response. This stew was both totally foreign and deeply familiar at the same time, in much the same way a perfectly seasoned dish is both undersalted and oversalted.

I really think he's on to something here. What I think it's about is *fascination*—how do you craft something that irresistably sucks people in. To do that, to really dominate their attention, you have to balance too opposing forces:

* You want some *familiarity and safety*. This gets their attention by calling up memory, resonating with their own sense of self, and giving them a sense security that it's OK to focus their attention on it.

* You want some *novelty and excitement*. A totally familiar sensation is boring, so it must also offer something new to capture interest. It can't be *too* safe because then it becomes same to *ignore* it. There needs to be a hint of danger or risk.

With food, it's the balance between tastes that remind you food you grew up with, along with a combination or some ingredients that are unusual. Ingredients that taste "bad" on their own—particularly sour or bitter—are a key piece of making food exciting. When you're cooking a dish and it tastes "boring" and you can't figure out why, it's often acid or bitterness that it's missing. A little badness to get your attention.

I've been thinking about these interplays a lot in the context of something totally different: horror. I'm a big fan of horror that has an emphasis on that creepy/eerie/spooky feeling. (I'm not personally into "horror" in the torture porn sense of lots of violence, pain, and bloodshed. I'm more Stephen King and Stephen Spielberg and less Bret Easton Ellis and Eli Roth.)

It took me a while to pin down what that creepy/eerie/spooky/wondorous feeling is, and my conclusion is that just like above, it's a combination of being both drawn in and repelled.

Think of the scene where the ghost is coming down the stairs in Poltergeist, one of the most iconic examples I can think of.

* One one side, you've got gently floating lights, a soft glow, gauzy wisps gently blowing, the vague shape of a woman. It reminds you of angels and heaven, familiar images of safety. All of this is wrapped up in the most familiar setting you can possibly imagine: the staircase of a perfectly American suburban home.

* But, of course, at the same time, you certainly never see angels floating down your stairs. The figure you're looking at is washed out and ill-defined. It's hard to feel confident that you know what you're looking at. *Is* it a figure? Those glowing lights are moving. Where will they go? It's most unusual, and you definitely aren't sure what the thing is going to do, or even what it is.

The scene balances right on the knife edge so that you are unable to decide "Am I looking at a threat?" You desparately want to answer that question, but the information it gives you is such a mixture of signals that you can't.
