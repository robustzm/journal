So you love electronic music and you'd like to make some bleeps, bloops, and
beats yourself. The only problem is you have no idea what to buy, how it works,
or how to set it up. You think maybe you need a synthesizer, but aren't sure
what that even means. This is for you.

I'll walk you through all the basic gear and terms for how we turn electricity
into sound today. My goal is to enable you to make an informed choice on what
to put your money into, and to hopefully end up experiencing the joy of making
music.

Note that this is *not* a detailed guide on how any particular kind of
synthesizer generates sound. I'm not teaching you the details of subtractive
synthesis our sound design here, though I will touch on the basics since it
affects which synth you might want. I like [this
intro](https://learningsynths.ableton.com/) on synthesis from Ableton.

## What is a synthesizer?

So, first of all, what is a synthesizer? My definition, which I think is pretty
good, is that a **synthesizer** is any machine that uses electronics (digital and/or
analog) in order to generate sound without relying on any moving parts or
electro-mechanical process. A drum machine and keytar are synths. An electric
guitar is not a synth because while it uses electrictity to produce sound, it
does so by converting the mechnical vibration of the strings to an electronic
signal.

The boundary does get a little fuzzy. A lot of keyboardists would consider a
clavinet or Rhodes electric piano to be a "synth", even though those work pretty
much like electric guitars in that they turn a physical vibration into an
electric signal. But they have piano keys and electronics, so synth nerds tend
to treat them as synths. Let's not get hung up on this.

Note that synthesizers don't always 

## Do you need hardware at all?

A lot of people who want to start making electronic music assume they *need* to
go out and buy a big synthesizer in order to make any kind of sound. Thirty
years ago, that was true. But today computers are powerful enough to make music
entirely on the machine you already have in front of you right now. There are
even music-making apps for phones and tablets.

There's two kinds of software 

These are called **software synthesizers** or just **soft synths**.
