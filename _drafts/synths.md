Like a lot of aging nerds, when I hit my mid-life crisis, I decided to get (back) into making electronic music. But what to make it on? These days, you can make music entirely on your computer, or you can make electronic music not using a computer at all with just an array of synthesizers, drum machines, and mixers. How to choose?

It's overwhelming, especially for someone just dipping their toes in the water. Fortunately for you, I am absolutely obsessive when it comes to learning a new hobby and I did all the research for you. In this guide, I'll try to introduce you to all the main terminology when it comes to hardware and software for making electronic music. I won't make specific product recommendations, because that stuff gets outdated quickly, but I'll describe all the basic kinds of gear and how they work so that you can make an informed choice.

So you love electronic music and you'd like to make some bleeps, bloops, and
beats yourself. The only problem is you have no idea what to buy, how it works,
or how to set it up. You think maybe you need a synthesizer, but aren't sure
what that even means. This is for you.

I'll walk you through all the basic gear and terms for how we turn electricity
into sound today. My goal is to enable you to make an informed choice on what
to put your money into, and to hopefully end up experiencing the joy of making
music.

Note that this is *not* a detailed guide on how any particular kind of
synthesizer generates sound. I'm not teaching you the details of subtractive
synthesis or sound design here, though I will touch on the basics since it
affects which synth you might want. Think of this guide as more like a
zoological field guide to the natural world of electronic music gear -- it will
teach you how to recognize the different kinds of music-making gear and how they
fit into the electronic ecosystem.

(If you want to deep dive on how to do sound design using a synth, I like [this
intro][ableton intro] on synthesis from Ableton and [this tutorial][syntorial].)

## What is a synthesizer?

So, first of all, what is a synthesizer? My definition, which I think is pretty
good, is that a **synthesizer** is any machine that uses electronics (digital
and/or analog) in order to generate sound without relying on moving parts or
electro-mechanical processes. A drum machine and keytar are synths. An electric
guitar is not a synth because while it uses electrictity to produce sound, it
does so by converting the mechnical vibration of the strings to an electronic
signal.

The boundary does get a little fuzzy. A lot of keyboardists would consider a
clavinet or Rhodes electric piano to be a "synth", even though those work pretty
much like electric guitars in that they turn a physical vibration into an
electric signal. But they have piano keys and electronics, so synth nerds tend
to treat them as synths. Let's not get hung up on this.

Note that synthesizers don't always 

## Do you need hardware at all?

A lot of people who want to start making electronic music assume they *need* to
go out and buy a big synthesizer in order to make any kind of sound. Thirty
years ago, that was true. But today computers are powerful enough to make music
entirely on the machine you already have in front of you right now. There are
even music-making apps for phones and tablets.

There's two kinds of software 

These are called **software synthesizers** or just **soft synths**.

outline:

- intro
  - purpose of guide

- structure of setup
  - some kind of hardware that can make a sound
  - an input device to tell it what sounds to make
  - a way to listen to the sounds its making
    - turn electronic signals into audio for ears
    - (alas, humans cannot jack directly into electronic voltages yet)
  - elaborate
    - room full of synths, drum machines, fxs, patch bays all wired
      together like enormous symphonic brain
    - keyboards, drum pads, sequencers, generative modular sequencers
    - route through audio interface to tube amps driving wall of speakers in
      dolby atmos configuration
  - simple
    - laptop, mouse, built in speaker
    - synth with keyboard, headphones

- brief history of making sound with electronics
  - talk about when various kinds of synth invented
  - useful to explain in chronological order because synth technology deeply
    tied to musical eras
    - 80s new wave sounds the way it does not just because the musicians wanted
      it to sound that way, but because that's when certain kinds of hardware
      came out
    - 90s hip hop is a product of samplers entering the scene at that time
    - i'm fascinated by synths in part because place where tech has huge impact
      on art world
    - when think of what music you want to make, often have certain genre or
      era in mind
      - want to make boom bap? want gear similar to gear used to originally make
        it
  - 60s moog and analog synths
  - analog synthesis versus digital
  - 80s beginnings of digital synthesis
    - fm
    - dco
  - 90s
    - sampling
    - wavetable
    - virtual analog
    - computer sequencers
  - 2000s digital explosion
    - granular
    - daw
