Like lots and lots of people, I've been following this year's election very
closely. I'm not into sports, so this is about the closest to it I get. And,
like an avid sports fan, I'm transfixed by the stats: the numbers that tell
how the teams are doing. Here's how [CNN][45] shows it (as of 5/12/09):

Very pretty. Lots of smiling faces and exciting vertical lines. Unfortunately,
for all those pixels, there's a hell of a lot of [chartjunk][47]. It's enough
to drive a [Tufte][48]-fanboy like me crazy.

Lets focus on just the actual chart part of the image:

![Where’s the top?][49]

   [49]: http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/cnn-bars.png

See anything missing? I'll give you a hint. This is showing the status of the
democratic candidate _race_. Don't races usually have finish lines? For all we
can tell, Obama and Clinton are neck and neck (argh, graphical pun not
intended)… somewhere… in the middle of the race.

But that isn't the case at all. Let's see if we can improve it a bit:

![Here at least we can see the goal line][50]

   [50]: http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/ok-graph.png

This actually shows the status of the race _relative to the finish line_. As
you can see, the finish line is looming but Obama and Clinton are still pretty
close. Clinton has about 89% of the votes that Obama has so far.

But actually, I still don't think this is the best we can do. The way I look
at it, the accumulated votes aren't as important as the _remaining votes
needed_. It's distance from the finish line that matters. If you're running a
500 meter sprint and you're 20 meters behind your opponent 100 meters in,
you've still got 400 meters to catch up. If you're 20 meters behind and 40
from the finish line, it's over.

It's the relative remaining distance that matters. Let's focus on that:

Now things don't look so close. Now lets see what the upcoming races can hope
to do:

![Upcoming primaries shown to scale][52]

Now it becomes obvious how much of a challenge Clinton has ahead of her.

Edit: I'll be removing any political comments. I appreciate the feedback, but
I'm sure you can find better forums for that. I'm more interested in
discussing the charts themselves.
