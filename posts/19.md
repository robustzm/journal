This blog has been dead for a while, but not because I haven't been writing.
On the contrary, I've been writing more than ever. I'm putting together a book
on game programming design patterns. I'm posting chapters online as they're
completed, and hope to have the whole text freely available online when it's
done.

It's here: [gameprogrammingpatterns.com][47]

Lots of people have asked for an RSS feed with updates when I add new
chapters, so I figure I'll make a quick post on this here blog thing when new
stuff is up. Posts related to the book will be tagged "[game-patterns][48]",
not that I expect to be blogging much else while I'm working on this.

It's a daunting project, but the support and feedback I've gotten so far has
been unbelievably motivating. Thanks, and wish me luck!
