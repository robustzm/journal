[code](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/category/code/ "View all posts in code") [2010](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2010/ "year") / [07](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2010/07/ "month") / [07](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2010/07/07/)


Because I'm a visual kind of person, one of the first things I do on a new
machine is get the syntax highlighting in my IDE(s) to something I like. At
the moment, I have a couple of different Macs that I work on, so I needed an
easy way to share my [XCode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode) color theme between them. I figured I may as
well put it up on [bitbucket](http://www.bitbucket.org). And if I'm going to do that, I figured I
may as well share it with the world.


The theme is called "Meltwater", and it looks like this:

(I'm also using Raph Levien's beautiful [Inconsolata](http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html) font) if you're
wondering.)


You can download the theme from [here](http://bitbucket.org/munificent/support/src/tip/xcode/themes/), or click [here](http://bitbucket.org/munificent/support/raw/fcef2059a901/xcode/themes/Meltwater.xccolortheme) for a direct
download link. Save it into your XCode preferences directory here:


`~/Library/Application Support/XCode/Color Themes`

Then you should be able to see "Meltwater" in XCode in the list of color
themes. Enjoy!
