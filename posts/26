## [Meltwater: A Color Theme for XCode][39]

Because I'm a visual kind of person, one of the first things I do on a new
machine is get the syntax highlighting in my IDE(s) to something I like. At
the moment, I have a couple of different Macs that I work on, so I needed an
easy way to share my [XCode][44] color theme between them. I figured I may as
well put it up on [bitbucket][45]. And if I'm going to do that, I figured I
may as well share it with the world.

   [44]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode
   [45]: http://www.bitbucket.org

The theme is called "Meltwater", and it looks like this:

(I'm also using Raph Levien's beautiful [Inconsolata][47] font) if you're
wondering.)

You can download the theme from [here][48], or click [here][49] for a direct
download link. Save it into your XCode preferences directory here:

   [49]: http://bitbucket.org/munificent/support/raw/fcef2059a901/xcode/themes/Meltwater.xccolortheme

`~/Library/Application Support/XCode/Color Themes`

Then you should be able to see "Meltwater" in XCode in the list of color
themes. Enjoy!
