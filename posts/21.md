I've finally gotten a chance to get some new chapters online for [Game
Programming Patterns][46]. They've been done for a while, but I had to get the
rubber stamp from the Powers That Be before I could up them up. They are:

  * [Service Locator][47]
  * [Type Object][48]
  * [Double Buffer][49]

   [47]: http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/service-locator.html
   [48]: http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/type-object.html
   [49]: http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/double-buffer.html

With this, I think I'm about a quarter of the way through what looks to be a
monster of a book. It's over 30,000 words already. I don't know whether to be
proud of how much I've got done or terrified by how much is left to do.
