## [New Chapter Up: Component](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2010/02/17/new-chapter-up-component/ "New Chapter Up: Component")

I've got another chapter of [the book](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) online: [Component](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/component.html). I think
it's a good pattern, but, man, it was a hard chapter to write for some reason.


Seven down, seventeen left to go. Daunting!
