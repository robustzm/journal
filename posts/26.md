Because I'm a visual kind of person, one of the first things I do on a new
machine is get the syntax highlighting in my IDE(s) to something I like. At
the moment, I have a couple of different Macs that I work on, so I needed an
easy way to share my [XCode][44] color theme between them. I figured I may as
well put it up on [bitbucket][45]. And if I'm going to do that, I figured I
may as well share it with the world.

The theme is called "Meltwater", and it looks like this:

(I'm also using Raph Levien's beautiful [Inconsolata][47] font) if you're
wondering.)

Then you should be able to see "Meltwater" in XCode in the list of color
themes. Enjoy!
