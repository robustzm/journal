I just put the finishing touches on a tiny little interpreter project: Jasic.
Jasic is a dialect of the [original BASIC][47] programming language. It lacks
functions and scope, but it's a usable language. Even on an old Apple IIe, it
was powerful enough to get me hooked on coding for life. Also, you can [draw a
Mandelbrot set][48] with it.

I wanted to see if I could fit a complete interpreter in a single readable
Java file. It worked out better than expected, so I went ahead and cleaned up
the code and commented the hell out of it. If you've always wanted to learn
more about interpreters, now you've got a little primer.

Here's a little code to give you a flavor of the language:



    ' initialize the loop counter
    count = 10

    ' stop looping if we're done
    top:
    if count = 0 then end
    print "Hello, world!"

    ' decrement and restart the loop
    count = count - 1
    goto top
    end:


Old school! All of the code is [right here in Jasic.java][49]. There's also a
[README][50] to help get you started. What are you waiting for?
